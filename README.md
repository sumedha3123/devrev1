# Customer Frustration Detection and Alert System

This project uses a Hugging Face pre-trained model to detect customer frustration from text inputs and integrates with DevRev to send alerts via webhooks. The system can process customer feedback, support chat logs, or other text data to identify frustration and notify relevant teams for prompt action.

---

## Features

- *Frustration Detection*: Leverages a pre-trained Hugging Face transformer model for sentiment analysis.
- *Webhook Integration*: Sends alerts to a DevRev webhook when frustration is detected.
- *Customizable Thresholds*: Set confidence thresholds to minimize false positives.
- *Seamless Integration*: Works with text data from various sources like customer feedback forms, support logs, and more.

---

## Prerequisites

1. *Hugging Face API Key*: Obtain one from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/).
2. *DevRev Webhook URL*: Configure a webhook in DevRev to receive alerts.
3. *Python*: Install Python 3.8 or later.
4. *Dependencies*: Install the required Python packages.

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-frustration-alert.git
cd customer-frustration-alert
2. Install Dependencies
bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file to store sensitive data:

bash

HUGGING_FACE_API_KEY=your_hugging_face_api_key
DEVREV_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-devrev-webhook-url
THRESHOLD=0.75
HUGGING_FACE_API_KEY: API key for Hugging Face.
DEVREV_WEBHOOK_URL: Webhook URL from DevRev.
THRESHOLD: Confidence threshold for detecting frustration.
4. Run the Application
bash
python app.py
How It Works
Input Processing: Text data (e.g., customer reviews, chat logs) is fed to the Hugging Face model.
Sentiment Analysis: The model predicts whether the text indicates frustration.
Alert Trigger: If the confidence score exceeds the threshold, an alert is sent to the configured DevRev webhook.
Example Usage
Input
json
{
  "text": "I'm extremely disappointed with the service I received."
}
Output (Alert Payload)
json

{
  "alert": "Customer frustration detected!",
  "details": {
    "text": "I'm extremely disappointed with the service I received.",
    "confidence_score": 0.87
  }
}

Development Notes
Threshold Adjustment: Fine-tune the THRESHOLD value in the .env file to optimize sensitivity.
Testing: Use sample data to validate the model’s performance and webhook configuration.

This README assumes the project structure includes Python files for handling the Hugging Face model and webhook logic, with modularity for easy customization. Let me know if you'd like detailed implementations for the app.py, model.py, or webhook.py files!
